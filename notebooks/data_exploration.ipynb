The website was XXXX whereas the authentic website is XXXX I proceeded to buy a gun from the fraudulent website and sent my money via XXXX as the spam seller requested, this was a total of {$450.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I received an email stating the transaction was approved and on XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to reach back out to the company in an attempt to give them the contact info of my chosen XXXX dealer, the emails started to bounce back ( there are also photos of this ). This was when I realized that this website was a faked, copycat website. I attempted to report it to my bank immediately when I realized a company I was dealing with was committing fraud and pretending to be a firearms dealer that has been in business for over 80 years and is a very well-known company all over the world. As my bank, I expected them to help protect me. I was told to wait until the money posted and then got a letter stating that because I initiated the transaction, they weren't refunding me my money. I reported the transaction immediately, expecting my bank to help me and they did nothing. This bank did not protect my money and could care less even after proving all the reports I filed about the fraudulent claim. It's sad that after almost a decade of business with me and my family, I don't seem to matter. I did report the fraud activity to the Federal Trade Commission, the Georgia State Commissioner, and the XXXX XXXX XXXX \\n\\nAfter reporting it to the XXXX Truist said they would look into it and I received a letter stating they couldn't get the money back so I wouldn't be getting it back either. Seriously? The company literally stole my money, how is that even an attempt at a resolution? \\n\\nAll of the information provided can be proven with screenshots and images. I also have the name of the original Truist rep we spoke to and the complaint number.\n",

Absent such proof, you must terminate this collection action and correct any erroneous reports of this debt as mine. \\n\\nFor the record, I state again that as I have no account with you, nor am I your customer, nor have I entered into a contract with you, I must ask for the following information : 1 ) Please evidence your authorization under 15 USC 1692 ( e ) 15 USC 1692 ( f ) and USC 1692 ( g ) in this alleged matter.\\n\\n2 ) What is your authorization of law for your collection of information?\\n\\n3 ) What is your authorization of law for your collection of this alleged debt?\\n\\n4 ) Please evidence your authorization to do business or operate in the state.\\n5 ) Please provide proof of the alleged debt, including specifically the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my wet signature.\\n\\nYou have 7 days of this notice to respond. Your failure to respond, on point, in writing, hand signed, and in a timely manner, will work as a waiver to any and all of your claims in this matter, and will entitle me to presume that you sent your letter ( s ) in error, and that this matter is permanently closed.\\n\\nYour continued silence is unacceptable. Either provide the proof or correct the record to remove the invalid debt from my credit files with the three-primary credit-reporting agencies. You are currently in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Debt Collection Act. I can't obtain housing or employment due to the violations on my credit file. \\n\\nFailure to respond within 7 days of this letter will begin my small claims action against your company. I will be seeking {$5000.00} in damages for the following : 1 ) Defamation 2 ) Negligent Enablement of Identity Fraud 3 ) Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act After obtaining the judgment against your company, I will obtain a Writ of Execution from the Sheriffs office in your county and I will begin the process of attaching property or funds to satisfy the judgment.\\n\\nFor the purposes of 15 USC 1692 et seq and 15 USC 1692e this notice has the same effect as a dispute to the validity of the alleged debt and a dispute to the validity of your claims. This Notice is an attempt to correct your records, and any information received from you will be collected as evidence should any further action be necessary. This is a request for information only, and is not a statement, election, or waiver of status. \\n\\nAs a consumer by law this account on this letter must be deleted immediately or I will seek monetary damages in small claims court in my city and state.

my credit reports that do not belong to me and was opened fraudulently i tried to handle the issue with credit bureaus but not a big help its still there.I checked my credit report and they had a wrong date of birth and addresses there to which i sent credit bureaus copy of my driver license with my real date of birth and an ftc report in which they did not responded and the account still remains on my report dramatically lowering my credit score.I will go ahead and attach the FTC report to my complaint and i expect credit bureaus to block inaccurate information.I also went ahead and talked to the creditor and found out that whatever information they have on their end the account that was opened under my social security number did not match with my date of birth or address that i reside on. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX Account number XXXX\n",

This is an old and account and has expired. \\n\\nAfter I have tried to negotiated with XXXX when I have called at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  and spoke with XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX about my financial situation and that she agreed that will be sending a settlment letter for the amount of {$1100.00} ( Please see a copy ) and that once the payment is received the account will be delete it from all credit reports. \\n\\nI have waited this letter before sending any payment and received around XX/XX/XXXX. I have proceed to send a XXXX Check settlemnet payment for {$1100.00} before XX/XX/XXXX via Certify Mail tracking # XXXX. I was tracking this mail daily and this mail was received at XXXX VA XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. But for some reasons it did changed and stayed as of today as '' arriving late ''. \\n\\nAfter a few days I checked again the Certify Mail tracking # XXXX for status and remains the same. Return Receipt # XXXX I have sent XXXX an email explaining that I have sent the payment but USPS tracking # reflects there was a delay. \\n\\nAfter investigating with XXXX  Check Cashing for status of check, for my surprise, the check was cashed by Portofolio Recovery Associates on XX/XX/XXXX ( please see copy with stamp ) which indicating that they actually have received the payment but for some reasons was not reflecting on the USPS Tracking site. \\n\\nAfter I have sent another email and letting them know that in fact XXXX received the settlement payment as agreed, they sent me another email requesting last four digit of social including some type of email agreement not to disclose the emails which I never confirm. \\n\\nAfter sending the email again with all finding including my last four of SS for them \" to verify the account '' no response as of today. \\n\\nThis account has been settled with agrement including the deletion of this account over the phone. And a confirmation for settlement was received via mail from XXXX. \\n\\nWether the Postal Office in XXXX VA assist XXXX to hide this information I want to request a deep investigation for violations to the XXXX XXXX at XXXX VA including how XXXX was able to cashed the settlement check without the Certified Mail signature confirmation. \\n\\nI want to report this to FTC Complaint for an investigation. \\n\\nAlso, I have checked my XXXX and all credit reports and does reflect a remaining balance to PRA that should be in fact settled, closed and deleted per our conversation with XXXX XXXX \\n\\nI have recorded all conversation in case they deny this as I have proof. I have also a have a witness as I have speaker phone when I have start speaking with XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nIn addtion, XXXX XXXX XXXX changed and signed a legislation for the statute of limitation in the state of NY from XXXX years to XXXX years starting XX/XX/XXXX. This account is already been expire which should be removed from all my credit reports. \\n\\nI am also aware that debt collectors like PRA buy by pennies per dollars old debts and trying to collect in full balance by harrasing the consumer, when they are not the original creditor. \\n\\nI am also requesting the deletion for PORTFOLIO RECOV ASSOC Original creditor : XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX {$3300.00} Account number XXXX. This account should be DELETE it as well from all credit reports as this account has been expired. Last payment was XX/XX/XXXX. But account was around XXXX. In addtion that the original creditor : XXXX BANK XXXX XXXX XXXX {$3300.00} Account number : XXXX this account is no longer reflecting in my credit reports. Therefore, the PRA should be delete for an account that does not exist! \\n\\nI am aware that XXXX did not bought this debtf or the same amount as the original creditors.. They buy debts by pennies for a dollar. Then run behing people asking for the full amount. This is how they make a big profit under the burden of the consumer misery. \\n\\nI am trying to get up on my feets but if this continue and unable to delete this accounts, I feel the pressure of Bankruptcy will be best option for all this burden. \\n\\nPlease see all communication, letters, proof of payment, tracking numbers, proof of a balance in XXXX XXXX reports, for your review. \\n\\nPlease note : some of the email I have trouble to print specially the first XXXX as this emails was protected from XXXX preventing me to print apropiertly. \\n\\nI feel cheated and disappointed\n",

       "353430    My Father, a XXXX XXXX  acquired an HECM reverse mortgage for his property through XXXX XXXX XXXX. In reviewing the contract documents, we have a reason to believe there may have been predatory lending.The loan was transferred to HUD at some point and serviced/managed by NOVAD Management . \\n\\nDespite our numerous attempts ( verbal and written ) to communicate with NOVAD Management since our Fathers passing in XXXX to purchase his property as his rightful heirs, we have been met with nothing but negligence on the part of NOVAD Management.\\n\\nTimeline in our COMMUNICATION WITH NOVAD Management : Total of 2 communications from NOVAD Management to the Estate in a 4 year time period ( from XXXX to XXXX ) : 1. XX/XX/XXXX - Condolence letter stating options given regarding the property. \\n2. XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX - Notice to Occupants of Pending Acquisition Total of 1 communication from Trustee Corps 1. XX/XX/XXXX - Notice of Default and of Foreclosure Sale ( NOD was recorded on XX/XX/XXXX and Notice of Foreclosure Sale recorded on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) Heirs were not provided sufficient notice for reinstatement of the Loan or sufficient notice for the Proposed Sale scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. \\nSpanning the time of an almost four year period, the property was in limbo. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, the Heirs received their first communication from NOVAD Management Consulting [ NOVAD ] in the form of a Condolence Letter directed to the Borrowers estate. This letter stated resolution options for the Loan. In XX/XX/XXXX, the Heirs contacted NOVAD via the phone number provided in the Condolence Letter, stating that the Heirs intended to satisfy the lesser of the outstanding Loan balance or XXXX of the current appraised value of the Property. The Heirs asked how they should proceed ( documents needed for submission, to whom they should be addressed, and what actions needed to take ). In response, NOVAD stated that the Property was not in its system and that the Heirs should contact the original lender, XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX  indicated that the Loan was paid off, was no longer in its system, and that XXXX XXXX XXXX  had no information on the Loan. \\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, the Heirs sent a letter to NOVAD requesting an extension as the Heirs still had no information as to how to proceed to satisfy the Loan. NOVAD did not respond to this communication. \\nIn XXXX XXXXa full three years laterthe Heirs received a second letter from NOVAD. This letter ( a Notice to Occupants of Pending Acquisition ) stated that the Property would be entering foreclosure within the next 60 to 90 days, in addition to stating that the then-current occupant would be afforded the opportunity to apply for continued occupancy by submitting request form HUD-9539. Nevertheless, no forms were included in the Notice to Occupants of Pending Acquisition. \\nUpon the receipt of the second letter, only other communication from NOVAD, the heirs proceeded to take action promptly, contacting NOVAD Management via mail ( certified, return/receipt ), and were met with the same negligence. The letter was never responded to.\\n\\nAdditionally, NOVAD has refused to communicate with the Heirs because the Borrowers will [ Will ] was not notarized. Notarization is not a requirement in the State of California to validate a will. The Borrowers Will is a statutory will that was signed by two witnesses. The Borrowers Will is valid and NOVAD should have been previously and presently communicating with the Heirs. \\nBecause of NOVADs noncompliance with its HUD-ordered duties, including to communicate with the Heirs, the Heirs were not able to arrange with NOVAD to satisfy the Loan.\\n\\nThe Heirs properly requested an extension to comply with the Condolence Letter options, and to obtain guidance. Yet NOVAD failed to respond to this communication, depriving the Heirs of their ability to resolve this situation and further impeding the Heirs attempts to save the Property from foreclosure. Scheduled three days from today. \\nI am appalled that an agency of our government such as HUD has contracted services with such a company. Many of the complaints from the XXXX, come from vulnerable elderly senior citizens potentially loosing their homes to foreclosure for lack of communication and clarity and negligence from NOVAD Management. This is not a current issue related to COVID circumstances. This goes back before COVID. We are not an isolated case, or the exception to the rule. We are an example of what is going on with many people loosing their homes, becoming homeless at a time when we are fighting homelessness in our streets. \\nElderly abuse, predatory lending in HECM Reverse Mortgages, non compliance with the law in following the guidelines and timeline within foreclosure processes, in a country like America, is unfathomable!!\\n\\nMy Father, a US Veteran, a proud American Citizen who worked for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and who followed his civil duties teaching us the principles of Honesty and Integrity, would be incredibly disappointed, that the injustices he saw while stationed in different parts of the world, are the injustices being committed towards the most vulnerable people in our country. \\n\\nI/We represent the thousands of Americans that are directly being affected by a poorly managed company doing a great disservice to a government agency ( HUD ) that is there to protect the public.\n",

      "THIS IS A SECOND COMPLAINT PLEASE DO NOT MARK AS DUPLICATE COMPLAINT BECAUSE THIS COMPLAINT IS IN REGARDS MY MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE APPLICATION DENIED ON XX/XX/2019 This year I was facing foreclosure because I can not afford the payments for a loan that I have with Chase because with the years the payment has steadily increased from {$130.00} to {$260.00} per month, also my health and financial situation are not the same as when I applied for the loan and the living expenses increased -Property tax, utility cost, Gas prices, Health Insurance- . I applied 2 times for a mortgage assistance and both applications have been denied, Chase just offered me a short sale or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure but both options will make me a XXXX homeless person. I am just asking to reduce my monthly payment in order to keep a place to leave, have food in my table and have all the medicines and medical treatments that I need to keep me alive. During the last 10 years or so I have been inundated with medical surgeries just to stay alive. I am a XXXX survivor and have had a lifelong XXXX issue that has become progressively worse. I have had multiple XXXX surgeries caused by other medical conditions and at one point my XXXX literally snapped in half and I needed to have emergency life saving XXXX. I have had XXXX because of all the medications necessary to live have thinned my XXXX   so much my own body started contaminating itself. The medications and the surgeries just exacerbated the issue and I had to have other surgeries to undo the damage caused. And all these things dont even begin to bring forth the light of what truly has happened to me medically. I am just trying to keep my history as private as I can while still informing you of the seriousness of my medical condition. It goes without saying that I am unable to work since I spend so much time just trying to stay alive. I am unable to work. Due to this I am unable to garner any real income to pay for this increase in the minimum loan payment amount you have just given me, to make matters worse my income will be reduce this year. I served as teacher for decades, My husband served the country in the military before pass away. I just asked to Chase for help modifying this loan I have with them, so I can make $ XXXX $ XXXX  monthly payments to the loan while I still live. The way I see it, Chase will get more money this way. Chase can always foreclose the home once Im dead and get the money anyways, but at least let me pay chase in {$100.00} installments so I can go on living my life in my home with whatever time I have left.\n",

      "On XX/XX/XXXX, my wife and I were involved in a car accident. Due to injuries we both suffered my wifes doctor did not allow her to return when her long term XXXX ran out, she lost her employment. She did however find a job in XX/XX/XXXX. Due to the initial job loss we fell behind on payments and applied for a loan modification. We were approved for the loan modification on or around XX/XX/XXXX my wife had significant XXXX XXXX and was unable to drive the 30 minutes to work, we tried XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. \n",
      "Nothing worked to help her with the pain and the doctor recommended XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX so again, she lost her employment as a result of injuries from the car accident. She was working through a temporary agency so they would not hold her job for her. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was told I had an XXXX in my XXXX due to my XXXX XXXX XXXX in the car accident, pieces of my partial XXXX XXXX broke off. In order to save my leg I had to have my XXXX XXXX, I was on XXXX XXXX for six weeks and then a total XXXX XXXX was done on XX/XX/XXXX. I work construction so I can not return to work for 3-4 months after my final XXXX. All in all I will be off from XX/XX/XXXX- MXX/XX/XXXX. As the primary income earner this is a hardship for my family. I have tried working with my lender and they said they have no programs that can help me since I have had a loan modification. XXXX XXXX said I will be eligible in two years. Meanwhile, we get hundreds of calls a week from Wells Fargo they send us letters saying they would like to sit down in person and go over the option but when I asked for someone to come here they said they dont actually do that. I should be eligible for some type of hardship since due to no fault of our own neither my wife or myself are able to work. Also when Wells Fargo did the loan modification they only lowered the payment by {$100.00} or so, this really wasnt enough to compensate for losing {$70000.00} In income. I feel it is unfair to charge someone such a high mortgage payment when they come to you for help. They are also making us pay mortgage insurance which is {$200.00} a month and out loan is paid down enough where that should no longer be an issue. They have delivered foreclosure payments to our child when he answered the door and have made me want to change my phone number because they call from early in the morning until XXXX XXXX XXXX at night. Its hard enough to lose your job due to injury but to wake up every morning to collection calls is horrible- they dont even stop calling us on the weekends.\n",

       "'  and      , CA  NATIONSTAR/.   #  We need immediate assistance with our   property loan.     is the investor of the property and   is the servicer for the loan. \\n\\nOur property has a domestic water well and the water is unsafe to drink. The significant and very serious water contaminations in the aquifers that serve our water well include : Lead Hexavalent Chromium ( documented in the movie entitled   ) and Arsenic. These chemicals are listed on the CA Proposition  List of Contaminants that Cause Cancer or Reproductive Harm. Serial testing of the water well by a CA Certified Laboratory defined the contamination to be steady-state as we were informed by the US EPA. There is no filtration system that can reduce these high levels down to potable safe drinking water levels. Our home is now defined* as : HAZARDOUS TOXIC CONTAMINATED UNINHABITABLE POLLUTED NON-POTABLE WATER BLIGHTED AND A NUISANCE ( *as defined by the CA List of Contaminants Proposition  State of CA, EPA Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment ( OEHHA ) Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of , Chemical Known to the State to Cause Cancer or  Reproductive Toxicity, the CA Water Code Section -, OEHHA Health and Safety Code Section . and the CA Department of Consumer Affairs ) This well is the only source of water for the property. We have provided  evidence based factual documentation of the contaminations, yet, this loan servicer has continually indicated there is no documentation of the contaminations in our file. We can only assume our correspondence has been continually lost, misfiled or shredded. When we have provided written documentation with evidence based facts that their correspondence has erroneous facts stated in the letter/s, the corrections to the file have never been corrected by Nationstar/. . \\n\\n// : We received Enclosure  from Nationstar directing us to contact the City of  with any questions we have with our water. This information is false and misleading as the City of  water systems have nothing to do with our property. The letter is also fraught with errors and omissions that we have sent corrections to the file/record that has not been amended. We were informed that Nationstar/.  has no contamination department and they are thus unable to help us with this loan. \\n\\n// : Our  County Supervisor provided a letter to Nationstar dated //( Enclosure  ) documenting our property is contaminated, does not receive City of    and does not receive City of  potable water. Our Supervisor further clarified that there are no current of future plans for the City of  to pipe potable water to our property. \\n\\n// : We received a letter ( dated// ) ( Enclosure  ). The letter is fraught with errors and omissions including this false statement : However, in //, our research found that the issue had been resolved by the City of  having rerouted utilities to provide non-contaminated water // : I requested to Nationstar outsource the loan to a servicer that does have a contamination department to help us. \\nWe did not request for our loan to be transferred to a servicer who has no department or loan products for our property. They refused to transfer the loan. \\nI provided a letter from the City of  dated // ( Enclosure  ) to Nationstar that documents Nationstars statement research, and conclusions are false. \\n\\n// : Enclosure  was sent to our representative at Nationstar/.  for review yet we have not received a response. \\n\\nIt is my impression that there are active efforts by Nationstar to provide an erroneous document paper trail and sell our property at auction// without disclosure of the property contaminations. This is a public health issue first and foremost. These contaminations define the property as HAZARDOUS TOXIC CONTAMINATED UNINHABITABLE POLLUTED NON-POTABLE WATER BLIGHTED AND A NUISANCE. \\n\\n// : Because this servicer has no loan product for our property, we are being forced to foreclose, short sale or pay the cost of the house as though it is not contaminated when it is contaminated. Nationstar/.  agreed to consider a short sale of the property ; a short sale real estate signed agreement from a CA Licensed Realtor was emailed to the representative. A purchase offer was emailed to him by the realtor // ; we wish to short sale because it will be less of a derogatory mark on our credit score than a foreclosure. The Natoinstar/.  representative promised to email our attorney and me //. This did not happen. \\n\\nWe learned later this afternoon the short sale process is denied for us to utilize ; the sale of our home is scheduled for  //. The asking price of the property is   dollars without disclosure of the toxic contaminations that preclude any buyer from safely drinking the water, showering, tooth brushing, etc. \\n\\nBottom Line : We have provided to this servicer the CA State Water Board information regarding the contaminations including : Nitrate contamination causes methemoglemia in babies ( blue baby syndrome ) and is unsafe for babies, children or pregnant women. \\nLead, Hexavalent Chromium and Arsenic are listed on the CA Proposition  List of Chemicals that cause cancer and reproductive harm Please see Enclosures  -. \\n\\nIt is my impression and understanding that Nationstar/.  is choosing to ignore the public health problems associated with this property and they plan to sell the property //without disclosure of the contaminations for financial gain.'"
